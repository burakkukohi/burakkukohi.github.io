\p{
  Let \cE be a locally cartesian closed category and #{f : B \to A} be a morphism of \cE.
  There is an associated \dem{polynomial functor} #{P_f : \cE \to \cE}, defined for every object #{x \in \cE} by

  P_f(X) = \sum_A\prod_f\pb{B}(X)

\p{We express this in the internal language of \cE like so:}

  P_f(X) = \ixsum{x : A}\prn{B(x) \to X}
